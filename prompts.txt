app detail with roadmap: Love the idea — it’s ambitious, super-meaningful, and very hackathon-friendly. Yes — this is feasible as a 13-day prototype if you scope tightly and pick pragmatic alternatives for the parts that are heavy (Aadhaar, NFTs, full payment flow). Below I’ll give:
	1.	Feasibility + key tradeoffs
	2.	Recommended Google-centric architecture & services (plus practical fallbacks)
	3.	Minimum Viable Prototype (MVP) scope (3 working functionalities) to hit the deadline
	4.	A 13-day step-by-step plan and task breakdown
	5.	Risks, constraints, and demo tips

⸻

1) Feasibility & tradeoffs (short)
	•	✅ Feasible to build a polished prototype in 13 days that demonstrates: artisan registration (with document upload), reel generation from images, automated story transcript generation, TTS voice, consumer feed with swipe/like, and basic moderation & recommendations — if you scope well.
	•	⚠️ Hard / sensitive pieces to defer or mock:
	•	Aadhaar verification: real Aadhaar APIs are restricted and need govt approvals — cannot integrate for hackathon realistically. Use DigiLocker / KYC providers or mock verification flow + manual review for prototype.
	•	NFT issuance on mainnet: blockchain integration adds time. For prototype, issue a verifiable certificate (signed JSON + QR or store metadata on testnet via thirdweb/Alchemy).
	•	Payments (real gateway): integrate later — you can demo a mock checkout or use sandbox mode (Stripe test or Google Pay test).

⸻

2) Recommended architecture (Google Cloud + Firebase focused)

High-level flow

Flutter App (Artisan / Consumer / Admin)
   ↕
Firebase Auth (phone/email) 
   ↕
Firestore (users, artisans, products, reels, comments, recommendations)
Cloud Storage (images, videos, transcripts, TTS audio)
Cloud Functions / Cloud Run (processing)
   ├─ Reel generator (assemble images → video using FFmpeg)
   ├─ Content pipeline: Web data fetch / Summarizer (Generative AI)
   ├─ TTS generator (Cloud Text-to-Speech)
   ├─ Moderation (text toxicity classifier)
   └─ Recommendations (embeddings + simple CF / similarity)
Generative AI (Vertex AI / Generative AI Studio) for:
   ├─ story/transcript generation from scraped facts
   └─ caption/enhanced description generation
Optional: Thirdweb/Polygon testnet for NFT stamping (or mocked cert)

Google/Firebase services to use
	•	Frontend: Flutter (single codebase)
	•	Auth: Firebase Authentication (Phone / Email) — easy and free tier friendly.
	•	Database: Cloud Firestore (document DB for listings, reels metadata, user actions).
	•	Storage: Firebase Storage for images/videos/audio.
	•	Serverless compute: Cloud Functions (quick) or Cloud Run (container) for FFmpeg video assembly.
	•	Generative AI: Google Cloud Generative AI Studio / Vertex AI (text generation for story/scripts). If credits are limited, use shorter prompt lengths.
	•	Text-to-Speech: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (WaveNet voices).
	•	Moderation: Use a toxicity classifier — options:
	•	PaLM safety tools (if available) or Vertex AI deployed classifier.
	•	Or use Perspective API (toxicity) or an open-source model as fallback.
	•	Search / discovery: Firestore queries + simple indexing; for embedding recommendations, use Vertex AI embeddings or store vector in Firestore and do cosine similarity (or use Vertex Matching Engine if you have credits).
	•	Optional NFT/testnet: thirdweb SDK (hosted) or Alchemy quickstart — interact via Cloud Functions. For hackathon, mint on Polygon testnet.

Practical fallbacks (if you run out of cloud credits)
	•	Run text generation with OpenAI free credits or smaller open LLMs locally.
	•	Assemble reels client-side in Flutter using packages (faster but may be less performant).
	•	Skip blockchain & use signed certs stored in Firestore + QR.

⸻

3) MVP (pick these 3 working functionalities — highest impact & demoable)

Pick any three; recommended trio for judges:

MVP set A (recommended)
	1.	Artisan onboarding + verified certificate (mock)
	•	Upload photos, address, government ID image (mock Aadhaar flow).
	•	Issue a verifiable certificate (signed JSON + QR stored in Firestore).
	2.	Reel generator
	•	User uploads 5 photos + optional short video → server assembles image sequence → FFmpeg to produce short reel (add autogenerated captions overlay optional).
	3.	Transcript & TTS story
	•	Scrape web facts (or use structured template) → Vertex AI generates a short artisan story → Cloud Text-to-Speech produces audio → bundle with reel.

Optional user-facing features to demo (if time allows)
	•	Consumer feed with swipe actions (left → artisan profile & buy, right → save).
	•	Comment + moderation pipeline (detect toxicity).
	•	Simple recommendation: use liked items to show similar crafts.

If you must pick only 3 features for submission, pick the recommended trio — they’re visually impressive and showcase AI.

⸻

4) 13-day plan (detailed sprint — assumes small team of 2–4)

Day 0 (preparation)
	•	Finalize features for MVP (use recommended trio).
	•	Create project repo, set up Firebase project, enable Auth, Firestore, Storage.
	•	Reserve Google Cloud credits and enable Generative AI and TextToSpeech APIs.

Day 1 — Auth, DB + basic Flutter scaffolding
	•	Setup Flutter app skeleton (login, artisan/consumer roles).
	•	Implement Firebase Auth (phone/email).
	•	Setup Firestore models: users, artisans, products, reels, certificates.

Day 2 — Artisan Onboarding UI + uploads
	•	Artisan registration screen (form + ID upload + address).
	•	Save metadata and uploaded images to Firebase Storage.
	•	Create mock verification step (upload ID → mark “pending”).

Day 3 — Certificate/Wallet mock
	•	Implement signed certificate: Cloud Function creates JSON certificate with artisan data + signs it with a server secret (HMAC).
	•	Generate a QR code image linking to cert (store in Storage).
	•	Artisan profile shows certificate + QR.

Day 4 — Reel upload UI & storage
	•	UI to select 5 images / short video + submit.
	•	Upload images to Firestore + Storage.
	•	Show pending reel state.

Day 5 — Reel generator (Cloud Run + FFmpeg)
	•	Create container that takes list of images from Storage, runs FFmpeg to make a 15s reel (simple crossfade or image-to-video).
	•	Deploy to Cloud Run and test.
	•	Cloud Function triggers Cloud Run on upload.

Day 6 — Integrate reel playback in app
	•	Consumer feed screen: show generated reels from Storage (play via Flutter video player).
	•	Implement basic swipe gestures (left / right / up).

Day 7 — Generative story pipeline (Vertex AI)
	•	Implement small Cloud Function: given artisan product name + region + web facts (or template) → call Generative AI to produce 2–3 line story & product description.
	•	Store transcript in Firestore.

Day 8 — TTS integration
	•	Take transcript → Cloud Text-to-Speech → store audio file.
	•	Show reel with audio in app (overlay or separate play button).

Day 9 — Moderation & comments
	•	Implement comment UI and Cloud Function to moderate text (call Perspective API or simple profanity filter).
	•	Flag/remove disallowed comments.

Day 10 — Recommendation simple model
	•	Implement simple content-based recommendation: compute embeddings for transcripts using Vertex embeddings, store in Firestore; implement similarity search (top-k by cosine) for feed personalization.
	•	Alternatively use simple collaborative filtering from likes.

Day 11 — Admin dashboard + aesthetic polish
	•	Admin Flutter or web view to view pending verifications, moderate content, approve artisans.
	•	Add UX polish, icons, colors, demo content.

Day 12 — End-to-end testing + bugfixes
	•	Create demo artisan profiles (paper mache Kashmir) with generated reels & TTS.
	•	Test on device and record demo video.
	•	Finalize README, architecture slide.

Day 13 — Final touches & submission
	•	Prepare pitch, short demo video (1–2 min), screenshots, and prototype link.
	•	Ensure three features work reliably and are easy to demo.

⸻

5) Data model & Firestore schema (brief)
	•	users/{uid}: {name, role: artisan/consumer, contact, verified:false}
	•	artisans/{id}: {uid, name, address, certUrl, region, tags}
	•	products/{id}: {artisanId, title, desc, price, photos:[url], reelUrl, transcriptUrl, ttsUrl, tags}
	•	reels/{id}: {productId, status, reelUrl, createdAt}
	•	likes/{userId}/likedProducts/{productId}, purchases/{userId}/…
	•	comments/{productId}/{commentId}: {userId, text, moderated:false}

⸻

6) Important implementation notes & tips

Aadhaar & verification
	•	Do not attempt to call Aadhaar APIs — they require formal access. Instead:
	•	Use DigiLocker APIs (if accessible) or document upload + admin manual verification.
	•	Show a “Verified via documents” badge after manual check or after KYC provider mock.

NFT issuance
	•	For hackathon: mock NFT + signed JSON cert is fine. If you want a blockchain touch, mint a metadata URI on Polygon testnet via thirdweb and show transaction hash in profile.

Reel generation
	•	If Cloud Run + FFmpeg is heavy, do client-side assembly using Flutter packages (faster to demo), but server-side gives consistent output.

Web scraping for stories
	•	Avoid scraping arbitrary sites in prototype (legal/robots). Instead:
	•	Use Google Custom Search API to fetch public pages and then extract small facts, or
	•	Use pre-curated knowledge snippets for each craft/region (you can seed this manually for demo).

Moderation
	•	Use a two-stage approach: automated filter (Perspective or Vertex model) + admin review.

Recommendation
	•	Embeddings approach (Vertex Embeddings → client-side nearest neighbor with small dataset) is fast and impressive.

⸻

7) Demo script (what to show judges)
	1.	Login as artisan → show registration + ID upload → show “pending verification”.
	2.	Upload 5 photos of craft (paper mache Kashmir) → kick off reel generation.
	3.	Show automated story generation and TTS audio playing with reel.
	4.	Switch to consumer view → show reel in home feed → demonstrate swipe behavior (save / open artisan page).
	5.	Open artisan page → show certificate QR & product purchase (mock) → show comment (and flagging).
	6.	Show admin approving an artisan or moderating a comment.
	7.	End with pitch: how this helps artisans and next steps (Aadhaar integration / payments / NFT real mint).

⸻

8) Risks, constraints & final suggestions
	•	Time: 13 days is tight — focus on the 3 core features and polish them.
	•	Cloud credits: keep an eye on usage (especially GenAI & TTS). Use small prompts, shorter audio samples.
	•	Legal/sensitive: avoid real Aadhaar flow; state clearly in submission what’s mocked vs real.
	•	Team split: parallelize (frontend + backend + AI workflows).

⸻

If you want, I can now:
	•	Draft the exact Cloud Functions (or Cloud Run Docker) command for assembling images into a reel with FFmpeg.
	•	Write the sample Cloud Function that calls Vertex AI to generate a 2-line artisan story and then calls Text-to-Speech.
	•	Create a detailed 13-day Trello/Asana task list for your team to follow.

so for this, i have already done the basic reel generation + transcript + tts function and deployed it to google cloud as well.

but i wanted to make it better since right now the reel is only crossfading betwene images. 

my idea was the following structure:
